# Intro

üöß This guide is under construction. üöß

The hope is that this resource provides a useful reference but nothing here is set in stone. Please feel free to comment with any questions or suggestions or feel free to ping @samajammin on Telegram. Thanks!

Hey there! Happy to have you on board, together we can go much farther.

The goal of this document is to provide guidance to anyone who is exploring the potential of organizing a Quadratic Funding round for their community and is looking for support from the Ethereum Foundation.

This guide aims to provide a high-level overview of the process involved & templates on how to structure a QF round, yet it is not intended to be a rigid solution. We have a couple of typical approaches on how to work together but we recognize there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all solution to how to best run a funding round for every community. While some technical & operational constraints do exist, in general we love new ideas on how to create the best outcome. If you have something you‚Äôd like to propose, please do share with us!

## Quadratic Funding

For those who don't know much about Quadratic Funding, here‚Äôs a few good resources:

- [WTF is QF?](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=10&grant=5,5&grant=2,2,2,2,2&grant=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1&match=1000)
- [Quadratic Payments: A Primer](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)
- [Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design For Philanthropic Matching Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656)
- [Quadratic Voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-voting/)

## QFI (Quadratic Funding Incubator)

Our team works on privacy technology that leverages ZKPs to empower radical democracy. We‚Äôre working to create a scalable way to support Quadratic Funding projects, by building infrastructure that enables community organizers to run Quadratic Funding Rounds.

We offer help in planning, operations, technical guidance, marketing, and impact analysis with a the goal of empowering organizers to become technically independent and ready to receive matching funds/grants. We want to activate more operators that will continue to run QF rounds for their communities.

Specifically, we‚Äôre looking to support community operators in the following ways:

- **Financial support** via grants for grassroots adoption of QF around the world
- **Technical guidance** to deploy ZK-powered Quadratic Funding infrastructure
- **Operational help** in terms of thinking through how to structure & manage round logistics
- **Marketing & comms** strategy to ensure your community has adequate content & education
- **Impact analysis** to help you set goals & measure success

We‚Äôre also building with a vision to enable communities to become completely independent. The goal is for organizers to eventually be able to run QF rounds without any involvement from us. Therefore, here‚Äôs a few examples of areas we do NOT provide support with:

- Smart contract or website deployment on behalf of organizers
- Direct technical or operational support for QF users
- Legal guidance on running QF rounds

In general it‚Äôs perhaps useful to think of QFI as project consultants. We offer you technical training & operational guidance but we do not directly execute QF rounds.

# Process

Here‚Äôs a general overview of the entire process to set up & run a funding round with QFI.

## Rough timeline

There is currently no ‚Äústandard‚Äù timeline. Timelines of rounds can vary widely depending on the structure of the QF round (e.g. duration of contribution period) as well as your team‚Äôs capacity in terms of organizing, promoting, deploying & operating the event.

That said, we typically recommend 8-10 weeks of lead time before running a QF round in order to adequately prepare. The more time the better üôÇ
